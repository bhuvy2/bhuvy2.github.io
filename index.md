I'm Bhuvan, people also call me bhuvy.

I love all things hacking, learning, and creating and have done so since I was a kid. My main mission in life is to figure out things and make cool stuff.

I have a laundry list of interests including but not limited to Tech, Data Science, Math, Psychology, Sociology, History, Literature, Economics, and a few of the [Arts]({% link _livepages/ikebana.md %}).
I keep my [reading list]({% link _livepages/reading.md %}) though it mostly includes books.
I believe that every problem that we have has been fundamentally solved; it's just up to use to connect the pieces.

I have most recently worked for [facebook](https://www.facebook.com) as a part of their election integrity team, but also worked at [fitbit](https://www.fitbit.com/home) on the sleep stages product and [Oracle Textura](https://www.oracle.com/applications/primavera/products/textura-payment-management/) for their payment service. I attended the [University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign](https://www.illinois.edu) where I received my Masters and Bachelors in Computer Science and worked as part of a course staff and the [Illinois Data Science Initiative](https://idsi.illinois.edu/news/).

I also write/journal about various things and put up tech demos as frequently as possible to keep my skills fresh.

In my spare time, I like to YoYo, Read, and play video games.

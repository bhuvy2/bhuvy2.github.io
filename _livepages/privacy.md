# Privacy

I take privacy very seriously.
Unless I ask explicitly otherwise, I won't share anything you've chosen to share with me.
Now, this might immediately bring up the question of why I choose to use Google Analytics, and I have a few reasons for that

* I want a technical understanding of the traffic on my site. If I ever try to move to self hosting, I don't want to be paying too much -- I certainly don't want to ask my visitors to donate either.
* I want to understand the surface level situation of my readers. I've come to terms that maybe 1 or 2 people in a month may fill out a feedback form or send in an email, but the other visitors will seldom fill out the form.
  I can only ever write from the perspectives that I know about, so if I become cognizant of a different viewpoint on an article through viewership, I'd be more than happy to consider that.
* If you still don't want to be tracked, you should install an ad blocker, but please give me some surface level feedback on the form (country, whether you like my work, and approx how much time you spend reading)

I won't be tracking the clicks of all of my users and the navigation flows on the site. I'm not going to be trying to monetize my users or sell you ads.

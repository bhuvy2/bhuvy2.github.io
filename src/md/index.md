# Hey!

I'm Bhuvan, people also call me bhuvy.

I love all things hacking, learning, and creating and have done so since I was a kid. My main mission in life is to figure out things and make cool stuff.

I have a laundry list of interests including but not limited to Tech, Data Science, Math, Psychology, Sociology, History, Literature, Economics, and a few of the [Arts](/ikebana).
I believe that every problem that we have has been fundamentally solved; it's just up to use to connect the pieces.

I have most recently worked for [facebook](https://www.facebook.com) as a part of their election integrity team, but also worked at [fitbit](https://www.fitbit.com/home) on the sleep stages product and [Oracle Textura](https://www.oracle.com/applications/primavera/products/textura-payment-management/) for their payment service. I also currently attend the [University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign](https://www.illinois.edu) for Computer Science and and work as part of the [CS241 Systems Programming](http://cs241.cs.illinois.edu/) Course Staff and was formerly a part of the [Illinois Data Science Initiative](https://idsi.illinois.edu/news/).

I also write/journal about various things and put up tech demos as frequently as possible to keep my skills fresh.

In my spare time, I like to YoYo, Read, and play video games.

If you want to research me on the internet or just chat, here is my [github](https://github.com/bhuvy2/), [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bhuvy2/), and [email](mailto:bhuvan.venkatesh21@gmail.com).

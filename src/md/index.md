# Bhuvy

Hi, I'm Bhuvan, people also call me bhuvy.

I love all things tech and datascience. I have most recently worked for ![facebook](www.facebook.com) as a part of their election integrity team. I also currently attend the [University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign](illinois.edu) for Computer Science.

I also have interests in Math, Psychology, Sociology, History, Literature, Economics, and a few of the Arts. I believe that every problem that we have has ben fundamentally solved; it's just up to use to connect the pieces.

I also write about various things and put up tech demos as frequently as possible to keep my skills fresh.

In my spare time, I like to YoYo, Read, and play video games.

If you want to research me on the internet or just chat, here is my [github](https://github.com/bhuvy2/), [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bhuvy2/), and [email](mailto:bhuvan.venkatesh21@gmail.com).

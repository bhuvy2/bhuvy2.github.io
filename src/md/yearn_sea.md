# Let Your Engineers Be More

When I was in middle school, I went on a particularly boring vacation.
Unfortunately forgot to bring Pokemon Diamond to kill some time.
Some looking at the outdoors, I thought why don't I just build a simple one?
All I had was a C++ book and infinite time on my hands.
And thus became the single simplest text adventure game, a few steps away from pokemon go.

That's how I got my start into programming.
Programming isn't required in schools, so me like many of the others who are in this field discovered software in some way like above.
We didn't see programming as solving cool technical challenges or developing products.
We simply saw it as a means to an end.
We had a cool idea and programming was a cheap, simple, and fast way to get from that idea to a working model.
We could make games, sites, little scripts to make our lives easier or to try and ruin other people's lives.

After working for a few places, I realize why more people whom I talk to don't want to do software for more than a few years.
Most of the people I meet are like me.
They are people who originally got into the field to make cool stuff but now are removed from the fruits of their labor.
You want to make a new interface? We are going to have to screen the wording through legal to make sure our constituents are happy.
You want to design part of the site? Let's get a team of designers to make sure it is intuitive.
You think you have a great app idea? Go through the motions of convincing upper management to adopt your idea.

Companies notice this and they are trying really hard at fixing this, but there really is no fix.
At the risk of sounding like a millenial, passionate developers don't want to be spending their time trying to figure out an alignment issue that happens with Simplified Han Chinese on Build 1.1.3.
They want to build things that they think are valuable and have a say in the process at every step.

There are tactics to try and combat this.
There are two big paths that Companies nowadays try to unite people under.
The first is these so-called "free-time" projects where you get to spend 80% doing something you are probably at best okay with and 20% of the time doing something new -- looking at you Google.
Apart from being massive Intellectual Property schemes that suck any ideas out of employess for corporate profits, it also turns into a rat race.
If you look at the payoffs if your main goal is to get promoted, you can either spend some time working on a project that probably won't get traction, and you'll have almost nothing to show for it.

The second option that companies do is build a motto or build a mission. I believe this derives from the quote by Antoine de St. Exupery.

_If you want to build a ship, don't drum up people to collect wood and don't assign them tasks and work, but rather teach them to long for the endless immensity of the sea._

Most of us nowadays see through this.
They see that their piece in the puzzle won't be figuring out requirements, or desiging UI, or even telling people about a project.
The best case scenario is that the product is new, and they'll have some say into the requirements at all levels
Worst case they are maintaining old code and being told exactly what to do.

The end result is this.
Although we see software engineers as incredible technical people, most of our roots are very non technical.
We want our opinions heard in design meetings and decision making because we like building products that we have a reasonable say.
Of course we can compromise (see I'm not _that_ millenial) but when you are given a series of tasks with some mission taped to the side of your wall, it isn't so appealing.
The alternative is you get a massive amount of people leaving the profession to go to places where their opionins are respected more.
Consulting, Machine Learning, Research, Product Management etc are all fields where people take snippets of doing a little bit of everything to deliver an end product.
The new generation isn't lost or hopeless
But if you want to build a ship, build the boat your crew wants to build.
